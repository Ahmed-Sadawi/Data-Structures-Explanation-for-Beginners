## TREE
## Definition
A tree is a non-linear data structure where each node can have zero or more children.
### Visual Representation
![alt text](<Tree concepts.png>)
  + **Root** is The first node in the tree
  + The link between any two nodes is called an **Edge**
  + A node that does not have any children is called a **Leaf node**
  + The maximum number of edges from a node to a leaf node is called the **height of the node**

**Note:**
  Any node can have zero, one, two, or more edges depending on the type of tree.

## Tree Traversal Types
There are many techniques to traverse a tree. The most popular are:
  + Depth first traversal (DFT) we go depth as we can then  backtrack with nodes we need  
    + Preorder vist the node in the order **Root --> Left --> Right**
    + Inorder vist the node in the order **Left --> Root --> Right**
    + Postorder vist the node in the order **left --> Right --> Root**
  + Breadth first traversal (BFT) vist the tree level by level, starting from the root and moving outward.
 
**Visual Representation:**

  + Preoder will be as **(ABCDKEFGL)** 
  + Inorder will be as **(CBDKAFELG)**
  + Postorder will be as **(CKDBFLGEA)**
  + level order (BFT) will be as **(ABECDFGKL)**
     
There are three typs of trees (Binary,Ternary,N-ary) in this repo we will foucuse on Binary and Binary search tree, AVL tree.
